# KSP mod pack @ CodeReptile

The focus of this mode pack is to bring new mechanics into the game, making late-game more challenging, while providing a shallow learning curve. I also provide a number of difficulty presets.

Abbreviations for mod types:

**Q** -> **QOL** - Quality of life. These mods are not supposed to change the gameplay much, but provide functionality I personally find useful.

**R** -> **Realism** - Realism improvements.

**M** -> **New mechanics**, adding functionality to the game, usually resulting in a difficulty increase.

**P** -> **Parts** - New parts, fuel types, etc.

**D** -> **Destinations** - Challenging new horizons.

**G** -> **Graphics** - Gotta look cool while crashing.

**G!** -> **Heavy Graphics** - Performance-heavy mods, install only on good hardware / lower settings.

**C** -> **Contracts** - If you're tired of identical tasks.

For example, a mod marked **QPG** would be a mod that adds parts, QOL features and graphics changes.

Also, since all these mods are supported by CKAN, I'm not going to provide links to them. Just search for the mod name in CKAN.

### ALL MOD VARIATIONS HAVE THEIR RESPECTIVE CKAN IMPORT PACKAGE. USE IT TO INSTALL ALL THE MODS AT THE SAME TIME.

## Vanilla++ setup:

Basically the vanilla game(difficulty-wise) with QOL and graphics mods + a few minor part additions.

### Manual install:

Unfortunately, not all mods are supported via CKAN, so you'll have to install them manually:

| Type | Mod name           | Quick description         |
|------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Q    | `Mouse Aim Flight` | MUCH easier plane control |

## Graphics enhanced setup:

### IMPORTANT NOTICE:

**If your GPU has low memory and you have integrated graphics, please make the first launch after installing mods with integrated GPU. Some mods like Scatterer will do unpacking during first launch
and might fail on low memory. You can then restart the game with the discrete GPU.**

ENHANCE!!!
